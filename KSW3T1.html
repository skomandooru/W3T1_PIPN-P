Memorizing the tool or command doesn&#39;t help with being productive and effective as a data science practitioner. Knowing how to find the documentation to help with a certain problem or error in the code is more productive and efficient. There are a lot of valuable functions in IPython and Jupyter, but there is one that will search stackoverflow for that specific problem which other programming tools don&#39;t. Other tools do not have this feature, so jupyter is very helpful to its users whenever they are stuck with a problem they can&#39;t solve. The built-in help() function in Python is what users can use to help them figure out the error in their code or any kind of error they are receiving. A small &ldquo;?&rdquo; character can help the user learn more about the function that&#39;s being used and can get an understanding of what they can do with what they are using. The ?? is a shortcut to going to the source code. There are various shortcuts in Python or Jupyter that a user can use. Reading documents can really help a user compared to looking them up on the internet. In one of the sections, it talks about magical commands that can be used in Python. Some of those commands are %run, %paste, %cpaste, %magic, and %lsmagic. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Shell is like a communication to a computer what the user wants to run. It&rsquo;s surprising to read that it started in the mid-1980s. There are many commands a user can use to communicate with the computer such as using linux commands. It&rsquo;s surprising to see that there are also magical commands that can be used in the Linux shell. I have never used the %timeit command, but it&rsquo;s surprising that it can be used to automatically do a large number of repetitions for you in Python. It would probably help when using Spark with Python. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">The internet and chatgpt are great tools that can be used to help with errors in code other than documentation if it does not help. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 2: Introduction to NumPy</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter is about implementing and talking about understanding different data types, the basics of NumPy arrays, universal functions, aggregations, broadcasting, comparisons, indexing, sorting arrays, and structured data. Language in Python is dynamically typed and flexible. The numPy documentation can be referenced if using the numPy library or any of the various data types. Data manipulation is easy with the numpy library in Python. The basic array manipulation types are attributes, indexes, slicing, reshaping, joining, and gluing it back together. Computing numpy arrays are inconsistent with speed, sometimes they are fast, and other times, they are not. The numpy library has built-in aggregation functions and can be used when working with arrays. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Broadcasting numpy usually uses a vectorize operation which can also be called a universal function. It basically a set of rules for applying binary operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder, and quotient). Comparisons using numpy are when boolean masks can be used to observe and change values within the numpy arrays. Boolean masking is the most used way to finish the tasks that require boolean logic and manipulation of data within its arrays. Fancy indexing is a way to access and change complex subsets of the values of an array within a large dataset. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 3: Data Manipulation with Pandas</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter is about data manipulation with pandas. Data manipulation is usually done after cleaning the dataset. It introduces the different types of objects in the pandas library. There&#39;s also information about how to handle missing data using code in Python while cleaning a raw dataset. So, it has a lot of information that a user would need in order to correctly and thoroughly clean a dataset they upload and code in Python. All of Chapter 3 is just documentation and important information users need to know while cleaning any dataset. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 4: Visualization with Matplotlib</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter just talks about all kinds of plots using the mathplotlib library in Python. </span></p></body></html>
